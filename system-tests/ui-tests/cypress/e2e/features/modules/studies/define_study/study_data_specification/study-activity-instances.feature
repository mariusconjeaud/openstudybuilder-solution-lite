Feature: Studies - Define Study - Study Data Specifications - Study Activity Instances

    As a system user,
    I want the system to ensure [Scenario],
    So that I can make complete and consistent specification of study activity instances.

    Background: User is logged in and study has been selected
        Given The user is logged in
        And A test study is selected

    Scenario: User must be able to navigate to Study Activity Instance page using side menu
        Given The '/studies' page is opened
        When The 'Data Specification' submenu is clicked in the 'Define Study' section
        Then The current URL is '/studies/Study_000001/data_specification/activity_instances'
        And the tab 'Study Activity Instances' is displayed

    # Note, not all columns are implemented in current release, columns for next release is marked by a comment tag
    Scenario: User must be able to see the Study Activity Instances table with State/Action options listed
        Given The '/studies/Study_000001/data_specification/activity_instances' page is opened
        Then A table is visible with following options
            # Note, this page do not have an add study activity instances, as all study activities and related study activity instances is listed, and instances is added via edit
            | options                                                         |

            | Show version history                                            |
            | Add select boxes to table to allow selection of rows for export |
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers           |
            | #                 |

            # 'State/Action' will cover a classification, is described below as well as in API specification.
            | State/Actions     |
        And The following columns available to be displayed
            # Details is a concatination of a number of attributes and related ActivityItems, will be described below
            #| Details             |
            | ADaM Param code |
    #| Activity concept ID |
    #| Instance concept ID |
    #| Required            |
    #| Default             |

    # Instance Class is the relationship to ActivityInstaceClass node
    #| Instance class      |
    # The following columns is based on relationship for ActivityItemClass, via ActivityItem, to CTTerms/Concepts
    #| Test code           |
    #| Test name           |
    #| Unit dimension      |

    #| Specimen            |
    #| Modified            |
    #| Modified by         |

    # The table list all combinations of study activities and study activity insrances.
    # One row is presentated for all selected study activity instances and the related study activity related to data collection.
    # If study activity is not related to data collection it will be listed with the state describing it is not related to data collection.
    # If no activity instance is selected for an study activity then the row is displayed for the study activity with blank activity instance columns.
    # If multiple selections is possible, and addisional selections can be made - then a row for the study activity with blank activity instance columns is available to support additional selections.
    # If no additional selections is possible, no extra row with blank activity instance columns should be listed.

    Scenario: User must be able to use column selection option
        Given The '/studies/Study_000001/data_specification/activity_instances' page is opened
        When The first column is selected from Select Columns option for table with actions
        Then The table contain only selected column and actions column

    Scenario: User must be able to see the Study Activities without any related Study Activity Instances
        Given The '/studies/Study_000001/data_specification/activity_instances' page is opened
        When Study Activities exists without any related Study Activity Instances
        Then these Study Activities is included in the table with values for the following columns
            | column | header            |
            | 1      | #                 |
            | 2      | Library           |
            | 3      | SoA group         |
            | 4      | Activity group    |
            | 5      | Activity subgroup |
            | 6      | Activity          |
            | 7      | Data Collection   |
            | 12     | State/Actions     |
        #| 21     | Modified          |
        #| 22     | Modified by       |
        And all other columns contains no content

# No fitering for 'Details' column - but filtering can be made for the individual specific columns
# Enable filtring on <blanks>/<null>
# Process for selecting new version of Activity Instance
