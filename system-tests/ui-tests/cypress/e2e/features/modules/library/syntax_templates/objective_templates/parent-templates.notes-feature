    As a user, I want to manage every Objective template under the Syntax Template Library
    Background: User must be logged in
        Given The user is logged in

    ### Page and Table viewing

    Scenario: User must be able to navigate to the Objective template under the Syntax Template Library
        Given The '/library' page is opened
        When The 'Objective Templates' submenu is clicked in the 'Syntax Templates' section
        Then The current URL is '/library/objective_templates'

    Scenario: User must be able to see the Parent Objective template table with listed columns
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers                |
            | Sequence number        |
            | Indication or disorder |
            | Objective category     |
            | Confirmatory testing   |
            | Parent template        |
            | Modified               |
            | Status                 |
            | Version                |
    #### NOTES:
    # The sequence number reflect the creation order of Objective Parent Templates
    # As some columns are very text intensive, we suggest some columns by default is hidden
    # Any user preferences will however overrule the default column display

    Scenario: User must be able to see the list of Pre-instance Objective Templates on the main page with options listed
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        When The 'Pre-instance Templates' tab is selected
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers                   |
            | Sequence number           |
            | Indication or disorder    |
            | Objective category        |
            | Confirmatory testing      |
            | Parent template           |
            | Pre-instantiated template |
            | Modified                  |
            | Status                    |
            | Version                   |
    #### NOTES:
    # The sequence number reflect the creation order of Objective Pre-instance templates by Parent Template
    # As some columns are very text intensive, we suggest some columns by default is hidden
    # Any user preferences will however overrule the default column display

    Scenario: User must be able to see the list of User Defined Objective Templates on the main page with options listed
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        When The 'User Defined Templates' tab is selected
        Then A table is visible with following headers
            | headers     |
            | Template    |
            | Modified    |
            | Modified by |
    #### NOTES:
    # User Defined Templates are created at study level, the distinct templates can be displayed here
    # Under Template Instantiations the usage on studies can be seen.

    ### Sequence number generation
    ### NOTE, these scenarios could be tested as part of API testing
    @pending_implementation @api_test
    Scenario: System must generated sequence number for Objective Parent Templates when they are created
        Given an Objective Parent Template is created
        # This could be with a reference to the API POST Endpoint and a following API GET Endpoint - or just formulated as a functional requrement
        Then the attribute for 'Sequence number' will hold an automatic generated number as 'OT'+[Order of Objective Parent Template]

    @pending_implementation @api_test
    Scenario: System must generated sequence number for Objective Pre-instance Templates when they are created
        Given an Objective Pre-instance Template is created
        Then the attribute for 'Sequence number' will hold an automatic generated number as 'OT'+[Order of Objective Parent Template]+'-OP'+[Order of Pre-instantiation]


    ################################
    ### Display controls
    ### NOTE, currently postponed - to be assessed if needed later
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to see a combined column of either the parent syntax template text or the pre-instantiation text
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Parent and Pre-instantiation Templates
    #       Then the column 'Template' will show the Parent Template text for Objective Template Syntax Templates rows
    #       And the column 'Template' will show the Pre-instantiation text for Pre-instantiations rows of the Syntax Template
    #   # 'Parent Template' is name property on the SyntaxTemplateValue node
    #   # 'Pre-instantiation' is name property on the SyntacPreInstanceValue node
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to see both Parents and related Pre-instantiations of the Objective Syntax Templates
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Templates
    #       When the user enable the display of the Pre-instantiation control
    #       Then rows for both Objective Parent and related Pre-instantiations is displayed
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to only see Parents of the Objective Syntax Templates
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Templates
    #       When the user disable the Display Pre-instantiation control
    #       Then only rows for Objective Parent Templates is displayed

        And an Objective Parent Template is being added or edited
        When the user select Template Parameter values on the 'Test parameter values' page step
        Then a rich text representation of Objective Template instantiation is displayed with selected parameter values in green text
        And non-selected parameters the parameter is displayed in yellow text
        And the resolving Objective Template instantiation is displayed in plain black text in separate field


    ################################
    ### Uniqueness check for Parent Template

    # If approval is for version +1.0 and any instantiations exist then a cascade update and approval is needed
    Scenario: Related objective template instantiations must be cascade updated to new version and approved when objective template is approved
        Given The test Objective Parent Template exists with a status as 'Draft'
        When The'Approve' option is clicked from the three dot menu list

        And the displayed pop-up snack must include information on number of updated objective template instantiations


    ################################
    ### New Version, Inactivate and Reactivate

    Scenario: User must be able to add a new version for the Objective Parent Template with a status as 'Final'

    #     Then The pop-up snack displayed with a value as 'Template in-activated'
    #     And The objective template is displayed with a status as 'Retired' with the same version as before
    # #? I assume a cascade inactivation should happen to all related Instantiations
    # MT: Yes

    # Scenario: User must be able to reactivate the Objective Parent Template with a status as 'Retired'
    #     Given The test Objective Parent Template exists with a status as 'Retired'

    #     Then The pop-up snack displayed with a value as 'Template reactivated'
    #     And The objective template is displayed with a status as 'Final' with the same version as before
    # #? I assume a cascade reactivation is needed as well for any related instantiations
    # # MT: Yes

    # Notify the standards developer if the current version is used by x # of studies in current versions - with the option to cancel new version creation

    # NOTE, TBD, we need to do the same for Pre-instantiations as they are also versioned


    ################################
    ### View History
    # Display value changes + status changes
    # On page level as well as at row level
    # NOTE, Indexing is not part of the Syntax Template, therefore the indexing is not part of the versioning nor part of the view history

    # Page level is not implemented yet
    # Scenario: User must be able to view history of value and status changes for Objective Parent Templates

    # Scenario: User must be able to view history of value and status changes for a selected Objective Parent Template
    #     #? Question, this must be possible for all states, Draft Final or Retired - do we need to test all combinations?
    #     # MT: no, I see no need to test all combinations - so have removed these
    #     Given The test objective parent template exists
    #     When The 'History' option is clicked from the three dot menu list
