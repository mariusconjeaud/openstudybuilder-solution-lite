@REQ_ID:1741028
Feature: Get released or locked study definition data from Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
        Given a test study identified by 'uid' is in status 'Locked' for the 'study_value_version'

    Rule: As an API user; I want the API to return an error code if a POST, PATCH or DELETE call is made on a locked study; So that I am not able to modify a locked study via the API.

        Scenario Outline: API must return error code and not make any data modifications if a POST, PATCH or DELETE /studies/<uid>/ endpoint is called with reference to a locked study
            When POST, PATCH or DELETE API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/<api-endpoint-area>' is called
            Then API must return error code '400' with message 'Study with specified uid <uid> is locked.'

    Rule: As an API user; I want the API to return the locked or released study definition data; So that I can integrate to the data content as it was defined when the data was released or locked independent of the latest draft version.

        Scenario Outline: User must be able to call GET endpoints with reference to a locked study and get locked study content from when the study previously has been locked independent of later changes
            Given study values for attributes <attributes> has initial locked 'values'
            When test study is unlocked into Draft
            And PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/<api-endpoint-area>' is called
            And study values for attributes <attributes> is successfully updated to new values
            And GET API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/<api-endpoint-area>' is called with reference to the locked 'study_value_version'
            Then the API returns the call with a successful response code '200'
            And the returned <attributes> 'values' from the locked 'study_value_version' is identical to the initial <attributes> 'values'
