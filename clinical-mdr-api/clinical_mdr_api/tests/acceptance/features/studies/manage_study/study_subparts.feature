Feature: Maintaining Study Subparts for a Study Parent Part in Clinical MDR API

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and test data exist
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API
        Given a test Study identified by 'uid' is in status 'Draft'

    Rule: As an API user,
        I want the system to support Definition of Study Subparts for a Study Parent Part,
        So that I can support Studies holding multiple parts with individual Study Definitions and Study Designs.

        Scenario: Changing the Project Number of a Study Subpart is not allowed
            When the Project Number of a Study Subpart is changed using the PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>'
            Then the API must return an error code as this change cannot be made for Study Subparts


        @TestID:test_cannot_lock_study_subpart
        Scenario: Locking a Study Subpart indepedently from its Study Parent Part is not allowed
            When a Study Subpart is locked using the POST API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/locks'
            Then the API must return an error code as locking of a Study Subpart indepedently from its Study Parent Part is not allowed


        @TestID:test_cannot_unlock_study_subpart
        Scenario: Unlocking a Study Subpart indepedently from its Study Parent Part is not allowed
            When a Study Subpart is locked using the DELETE API endpoint '/studies/<uid>/locks'

            Then the Study Subpart acronym or description is updated for the Study Subpart

        @TestID:test_reordering_study_subparts
        Scenario: Reordering a Study Subpart within its Study Parent Part is allowed
            When a Study Subpart is reordered using the PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>'
            Then the Study Subpart will get a new derived Study Subpart ID
            And consecutive Study Subparts are assigned a consecutive new derived Study Subpart ID
            And all derived Study Subpart ID are unique within the set of subparts for the Study Parent Part


        Scenario: Changing the Study fields or selections except the Study Title and Registry Identifiers of a Study Subpart is allowed
            When Study fields or selections except the Study Title and Registry Identifiers are updated using the PATCH API endpoint 'studies/<uid>'
            Then the updated Study fields or selections are updated for the Study Subpart


        ### Remove sub parts
        @TestID:test_cannot_delete_study_parent_part
        Scenario: Deleting a Study Parent Part having Study Subparts is not allowed
            When a Study Parent Part having Study Subparts is deleted using the DELETE API endpoint '/studies/<uid>'
            Then the API must return an error code as deletion of Study Parent Part having Study Subparts is not allowed


        Scenario: Removing a Study Subpart from a Study Parent Part is allowed
            When a Study Subpart is removed from a Study Parent Part using the PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>'
            Then the Study Subpart will be removed from the Study Parent Part
            And remaining Study Subparts are assigned a consecutive new derived Study Subpart ID
            And the value for derived Study Subpart ID, Subpart acronym and description is cleared

        Scenario: When the last Study Subpart is removed from a Study Parent Part then the Study Parent Part change to be a normal Study
            When the last Study Subpart is removed from a Study Parent Part using the PATCH API endpoint '/studies/<uid>'
            Then the Study Subpart will be removed from the Study Parent Part
            And the value for derived Study Subpart ID, Subpart acronym and description is cleared
