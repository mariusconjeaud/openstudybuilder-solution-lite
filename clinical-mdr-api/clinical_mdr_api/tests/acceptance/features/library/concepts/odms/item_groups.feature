Feature: ODMs Item Groups API

    As a Standards Developer,

    I want to create and maintain ODM Item Groups in the library, and relate them to our
    data concepts,

    So that they can be used consistently across studies, ensuring consistent mapping to Operational Data Model (ODM)
    and the Standards Data Tabulation Model (STDM) and its Implementation guide (STDMIG)
