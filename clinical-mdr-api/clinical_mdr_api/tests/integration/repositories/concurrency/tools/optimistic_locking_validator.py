        A framework for validating that optimistic locking is in place to prevent concurrent updates.

        As arguments, it takes three methods:
        :param main_operation_before: repository operations that grab a lock on parts of the Neo4j graph.
        :param concurrent_operation: concurrent repository operations that need to wait for locks to become free.
        :param main_operation_after: repository operations after which the locks are released.

        The method sets up two concurrency database transactions:
        - Transaction A, which calls main_operation_before() and main_operation_after()
        - Transaction B, which calls concurrent_operation().
        concurrent_operation() is called in between main_operation_before() and main_operation_after().

        Calling the method tests that:
        - concurrent_operation() waits for the locks to be released by main_operation_before().
        - concurrent_operation() finishes after the locks are released by main_operation_after().
