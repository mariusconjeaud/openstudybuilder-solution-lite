Functionality: Sorts the results by `field_1` with sort order indicated by its boolean value, then by `field_2` etc.

Example: `{"topic_code": true, "name": false}` sorts the returned list by `topic_code ascending`, then by `name descending`.

"""

FILTERS = """
JSON dictionary of field names and search strings, with a choice of operators for building complex filtering queries.

Default: `{}` (no filtering).

Functionality: filters the queried entities based on the provided search strings and operators.

Format:
`{"field_name":{"v":["search_str_1", "search_str_1"], "op":"comparison_operator"}, "other_field_name":{...}}`

- `v` specifies the list of values to match against the specified `field_name` field\n
    - If multiple values are provided in the `v` list, a logical OR filtering operation will be performed using these values.

- `op` specifies the type of string match/comparison operation to perform on the specified `field_name` field. Supported values are:\n
    - `eq` (default, equals)\n
    - `ne` (not equals)\n
    - `co` (string contains)\n
    - `ge` (greater or equal to)\n
    - `gt` (greater than)\n
    - `le` (less or equal to)\n
    - `lt` (less than)\n
    - `bw` (between - exactly two values are required)\n
    - `in` (value in list).\n

Note that filtering can also be performed on non-string field types. 
For example, this works as filter on a boolean field: `{"is_global_standard": {"v": [false]}}`.\n

Wildcard filtering is also supported. To do this, provide `*` value for `field_name`, for example: `{"*":{"v":["search_string"]}}`.

Wildcard only supports string search (with implicit `contains` operator) on fields of type string.\n

Finally, you can filter on items that have an empty value for a field. To achieve this, set the value of `v` list to an empty array - `[]`.\n

Complex filtering example:\n
`{"name":{"v": ["Jimbo", "Jumbo"], "op": "co"}, "start_date": {"v": ["2021-04-01T12:00:00+00.000"], "op": "ge"}, "*":{"v": ["wildcard_search"], "op": "co"}}`
