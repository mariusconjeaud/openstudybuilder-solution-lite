Business logic:
 - If parameter at_specified_date_time is specified then the latest/newest representation of the concept at this point in time is returned. The point in time needs to be specified in ISO 8601 format including the timezone, e.g.: '2020-10-31T16:00:00+02:00' for October 31, 2020 at 4pm in UTC+2 timezone. If the timezone is ommitted, UTC�0 is assumed.
 - If parameter status is specified then the representation of the concept in that status is returned (if existent). This is useful if the concept has a status 'Draft' and a status 'Final'.
 - If parameter version is specified then the latest/newest representation of the concept in that version is returned. Only exact matches are considered. The version is specified in the following format: <major>.<minor> where <major> and <minor> are digits. E.g. '0.1', '0.2', '1.0', ...
