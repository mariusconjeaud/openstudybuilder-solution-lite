State before:
 - Study must exist and study status must be in draft.

Business logic:
 - A subset of the visit types are of the type being a time reference (the sponsor defined term exist both in the code list visit type as well as time reference) - only one visit in the study visits can refer to a visit type related to a specific time reference.
 
 - The initial study visit specified for a study must refer to a visit type being a time reference type, it must have this as the time reference as well, and the time value must be set to 0.
 
 - All other study visits, than the initial visit, must either refer to a time reference that exist as a visit type for one of the other study visits for the study; or refer to the time reference for 'previous visit'. [previous visit needs to be selected in up - this probably will not be implemented in 0.1]

 - The duration time must be calculated as the duration time at the visit for the reference time + the time value specified for the study visit. [absolute value of time difference from initial reference time visit (e.g. the Baseline visit)" - to be discussed in point 3]
 
 - The duration time must be returned in the duration time unit specified for the related study epoch. [changed calculated to returned]
 
 - The time value is only valid, if the derived duration time for the study visit is greater than or equal to the duration time for the last study visit in the previous study epoch (given the study visit not is in the first epoch). [depending on a epoch definition, not in v 0.1]
 
 - The time value is only valid, if the derived duration time for the study visit is less than or equal to the duration time for the first study visit in the following study epoch (given the study visit not is in the last epoch). [depending on epoch definition, not in c 0.1)
 ]
 - The study day number is derived as:
    - Equal to the derived study duration time in days if value is less than 0.
    - Equal to 1 + the derived study duration time in days if value is greater than or equal to 0.
    - If the derived study duration time is blank, then the study day number must also be blank.
    - The derived result for the study day number is rounded: If result is below zero, the result is rounded using ceil function. Otherwise the result is rounded using floor function.
   
 - The study day label is a text string derived by concatenation of: Day+<space>+[Study day number]
 - The study week number is derived as
    - Equal to the derived study duration time in weeks if value is less than 0.
    - Equal to 1 + the derived study duration time in weeks if value is greater than or equal to 0.
    - If the derived study duration time is blank, then the study week number must also be blank.
    - The derived result for the study week number is rounded: If result is below zero, the result is rounded using ceil function. Otherwise the result is rounded using floor function.
 - The study week label is a text string derived by concatenation of:  Week+space+[Study week number]


 - The visit number is derived as an running integer with 1 for the very first visit sorted by chronological order (i.e. 1, 2. 3, 4, etc.). [NOTE: we have to figure out a rule for how we avoid counting sub visits? 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc?]
 
 - The unique visit number is derived as an integer with 10 for the very first visit, increasing with +10 for each visit, sorted by chronological order  (i.e. 10, 20. 30, 40, etc.). [NOTE: we have to figure out a rule for how we create unique visit numbers for sub visits?]
 
 - The visit name is a text string derived by concatenation of: Visit+space+[Visit number]+[Visit sub-label] (if available)
 
 - The visit short name is a text string derived by concatenation of: V+[Visit number]+[Visit sub-label] (if available)


State after:
 - the visit is added as study visit to the study.
 - Added new entry in the audit trail for the creation of the study-visit .
 - new simple concepts are possibly created based on the result of the "get or create" operation.
 
Possible errors:
 - Invalid study-uid.
