Filters a json datafile (assumed to contain a list of objects) to include only the ones referenced by another json file.
Arguments:
- name of datafile to filter
- key to filter on, full path separated by "."
- name of datafile used as filter
- key to use as filter, full path separated by "."

Example 1, reduce the activities file:
 "concepts.activities.activities.json"
by only inlcuding activities that are referenced by the file:
 "studies.Study_000002.study-activities.json"
> python tools/filter_json.py datafiles/mockup/exported/concepts.activities.activities.json uid datafiles/mockup/exported/studies.Study_000002.study-activities.json activity.uid

Example 2, reduce the activity subgroups file:
 "concepts.activities.activity-sub-groups.json"
by only inlcuding the subgroups that are referenced by the file:
 "studies.Study_000002.study-activities.json"
> python tools/filter_json.py datafiles/mockup/exported/concepts.activities.activity-sub-groups.json uid datafiles/mockup/exported/studies.Study_000002.study-activities.json activity.activity_subgroup.uid
