# OpenStudyBuilder Commits changelog

## V 0.10.0

## Fixes and Enhancements

- The automatic visit numbering and naming functionality now support naming a visit as 'Visit 0' when the first visit in the study timeline is defined as an information visit.
- CDISC USDM generation is now integrated into the native API and can also be displayed and downloaded under the menu Studies -> View Specifications -> USDM.
- Introducing a new visit subclass called Repeating visit, which can typically be used in non-interventional studies. It is useful when participants need to return for the same visit multiple times based on their individual needs (for example, one participant may come to visit 3 five times, while another may have 10 visits as visit 3). If there are any requirements about the repetition of such visits (daily, weekly, monthly), then it can be defined via the Repeating frequency item. Note that Repeating visits should be used if you do not know in advance the number of repeats that will occur. If a fixed number of similar visits is planned, then these should be created as single scheduled visits and grouped in a consecutive visit group. Please find more details in the StudyBuilder Documentation Portal.
- Compound API partly prepared for refactoring, but functionality is not yet enabled for use.
- The API supports returning study selections related to sponsor and CDISC CT for the specific CT package selected for the study.
- It is now possible to edit and delete Clinical Programmes and Project on the Admin Definitions pages in Library.
- Study Visits can be marked as a SoA milestone, and then the related visit type can be displayed in the protocol SoA table header. On the protocol SoA page you can decide to display the SoA milestone, the study epochs, or both. The SoA milestones can also be displayed on the Study Design figure.
- Various performance improvements for Activities in Library
- When adding a study visit, the list of "Existing visits Names and Timing" can now show visit timing as either Week or Day depending on what "Time unit" the user selects in the Add study visit form. A sticky bar has been added to all History pages making actions for download or closing the window easy available at all times without the need for scrolling.
- When adding Activities from other studies it is now possible to search for a study to select from by using its acronym instead of the study id.
- Selected components in tables (eg. search fields, filter, dropdowns and action buttons) of the StudyBuilder user interface have been aligned to the Novo Nordisk design system to increase the visual consistency of the user interface.
- Front-end refreshes data from the back-end on switching pages/tabs
- Redesign of the Schedule of Activities and the footnotes section has been initiated. Among other improvements several of the SoA tabs have been combined into one tab.

## New Features

- New Neodash report to search and list CT code list and terms with history evolution over time.
- First version of StudyBuilder Consumer API exposing GET /studies endpoint
- A "Reports" button have been added to the top bar. Clicking this button opens a landing page in a new tab where existing NeoDash reports and dashboards are available. These reports can be used to deep dive in the standards and study information available in the StudyBuilder database.

## V 0.4 (24-APR-2023)

### Fixes and Enhancements
- UI/UX improvements.
- Activity Placeholder updates and its corresponded API, UI, Logical and Physical data model updates.
- Sharing OpenStudyBuilder Solution code to Public gitlab (NN SBOM task file updates).
- Activity concepts model improvements, logical & physical data model updates.
- Enabling Study Metadata Listings, properties for generation of SDTM and relevant API endpoint updates.
- Improvements of CRF Management with vendor extension, CRF display in HTML or PDF format and OID & UID refactoring.
- Database Consistency Checks for Versioning Relationships on Library Nodes.
- Additional capabilities on Activity Instance and Item Class Model.
- Improved support for ODM.XML vendor extensions.
- Legacy migration of Activity Instance concepts have been adjusted to match the updated data model. Note the content is not fully curated yet, improvements will therefore come in next release.
- Global Audit Trail report shared as a NeoDash report (intially NeoDash report runs separately).

### New Features
- Locking and Versioning of Study Metadata (incl. API and UI Designs, Logical and Physical Data model updates).
- Import of core SDTM and SDTMIG data models from CDISC Library is supported now (Part of the foundational data model representation linked to the Activity Concepts model similar to the CDISC Bio-medical Concepts mode).
- The Data Model and Data Model IG data structures is extended with a number of attributes to support sponsor needs. Note the UI is not yet made for these part - sample data is loaded into the system database for utilisation by NeoDash reports.
- Initial version of DDF API adaptor enabling Digital Data Flow (DDF) compatible access to StudyBuilder as a DDF Study Definition Repository (SDR) solution.
- The data import repository will also include a DDF sample study. 
- The listing of activity concepts include links to overview pages of bot an Activity Concept and an Activity Instance Concept. This is on two separate tabs, one showing a form based overview and one showing a simplifies YAML based overview. The YAML based overview will in a later release be made fully CDISC COSMoS compliant.
- A NeoDash Report displayed with outbound relationships from the versioned value node.
- A NeoDash based report is included with a more comprehensive display and browsing capabilities of Activity Concepts. This NeoDash report in shared in the neo4j-mdr-db git repository and must be launched manually.

- Fix applied on visual indication of required/mandatory (*) fields in UI so unnecessary error messages can be avoided.

### New Features
- Further additions to CRF library module.
- API refactoring done, majorly use of snake case and aligning SB API with Zalando Rest API guidelines.

- Added separate README to allow for starting up the OpenStudyBuilder only using Docker for neo4j and the respective technologies for the rest of the components, such as python and yarn. This can be found in DeveloperSetupGuide.md.
- General source code quality improvements, below mentioned:
  - Aligned SB API with Zalando REST API Guidelines, e.g. naming of endpoints, query and path parameters, proper usage of HTTP methods etc.
  - A number of API refactorings to be more consistent in design and use of snake case including: Aligned StudyBuilder API with Zalando REST API Guidelines, e.g. naming of endpoints, query and path parameters, proper usage of HTTP methods etc.
  - Fixed major warnings reported by Pylint/SonarLint static code analyzers.
  - Removed unused endpoints and code.
- Filtering corrected for Activities in a number of places.
