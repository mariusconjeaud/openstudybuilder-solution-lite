# Study Data Model
In the graph, the representation of a study (including its history & selections) 
is a set of nodes and relationships. To embed the complex, nested structure of a study, several node labels and relationship types are used.
To record the history of studies, including their selections and fields, a special type of versioning logic is implemented.
This is [documented here](#studyversioning).

The image below shows the part of the physical model relating to studies and study versioning.

## Terminology
The following terminology is used when describing the study representation in the graph.

| Concept          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clinical Programme   | A programme that contains one or more projects.                                                                                                                  |
| Project          | A project that contains one or more studies.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Study Root       | A reference to the study, containing the unique identifier.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Study State      | State of a study value. One of [Draft, Released, Locked, Deleted].                                                                                                                                                         |
| Study Value      | A representation of a study in a given state.  A StudyRoot may have several StudyValues, each value has a single StudyState.                                                                                               |
| Study Properties | Study identifiers. These are stored on the StudyValue node.                                                                                                                                                |
| Study Fields     | Non-versioned properties of a study. Examples are registry identifiers or projects.                                                                                                                                        |
| Study Selections | Any selection made by a study. StudyObjectives, StudyEndpoints, StudyCompounds are examples of Study Selections. Selections are ordered, and can have a level.                                                             |
| Audit Trail      | A ‘log’ of how a study was modified over time. The audit trail contains edits of study properties, study fields, study selections, and state changes of the study (e.g. releases).                           |
| Study Actions    | An action represents a single change made to a study. Some examples are “Edit”, “Release” or “Delete”. An action record will contain the objects the action was performed on. An audit trail is a ordered list of actions. |

### Study Properties
Study properties are the identifiers of a study. These are stored directly on the StudyValue node.
The set of properties should be kept minimal, and is assumed to be rarely changed.
Changing the study properties is a costly operation in the graph. 

Example study properties:
```
uid: String
study_number: String
study_id: String
study_acronym: String
```

> Study nodes will be ‘thin’, only containing the identification properties of the study. Any other (unversioned) fields of the study will be a separate study field node.

### Study Selections
Study selections are the versioned library elements selected for a study. (Objectives, Endpoints, etc.) 
These can optionally have a level assigned to them. Selections for a given type are always ordered.
Selections are materialized as separate nodes in the graph. Each selection node can then have three nodes linked to it:
- The study the selection is for (a StudyValue node)
- A value of a library element (e.g. an ObjectiveValue node)
- A selection level (e.g. an ObjectiveLevel node)

Selection nodes are intended to be used as pointers, they do not have any properties assigned to them besides the order. Study Selections will have a `HAS_SELECTED_XXXX` relationship to the library element that contains a selection date property.

#### Deleting Selections
Consider the case where a study selection gets deleted, and that selection is linked to other study selections. For example, a study objective with linked study endpoints. On deletion of the study objective, no other selections are deleted, only the links from the study objective to the study endpoints are removed.

### Study Fields
Unlike selections, study fields represent links to unversioned library elements. These include projects, registry identifiers, selected populations and others.

In principle, study fields represent data that is logically stored together with the study.
In the graph however, these are not in the StudyValue, but rather as separate nodes. This allows for a cleaner, easier to maintain audit trail. 
In addition, this lets the domain layer be flexible in assigning different sets of fields (like key/value pairs) to a study.

Study fields have no order, and do not contain a selection date explicitly in the graph.
Study field values can be `null`, if this is the case, the study field nodes will have a relationship to a `NullValueReason` node.

The image below (see Section 'Neo4j Data Model') shows how studies, study selections and study fields are modeled in the graph.

### Study Actions
An `Action` node in the graph represents an item in the audit trail.
An `Action` node has one extra label (`Edit`, `Create`, ...)  to track the type of action performed.
Actions will have outgoing relationships to the elements changed during that action.

An action node may only have a single `BEFORE` and a single `AFTER` relationship linked to it.
If multiple study fields/selections are changed in a single edit operation, this will result in multiple study actions in the graph.
Outgoing `BEFORE`/`AFTER` relationships will have an `index` property on them, so that we can trace back which values replaces another.

### Operations on Studies
With this terminology in mind, the API must be able to:
- Retrieve an ordered list of study actions (Audit Trail) for a study.
- Distinguish and log different types of actions.
- Represent multiple versions of a study.
- Distinguish between the different versions of a study root:
  - (0...1) releases
  - (0...1) latest drafts
  - (0...1) latest locked versions
  - (0...n) locked versions
  - (1...n) old drafts
  - (0...1) deleted versions
  
The next sections will describe in detail how each of these components of the conceptual study view are defined.


## Business Logic
The following (sub)sections describe how the business logic around studies translates to operations on the graph data.

### <a name="studyversioning"></a>Study Versioning Logic
Study versioning is fundamentally different from versioning library elements. 
The below state diagram expresses how a study changes state after certain operations are performed.
Note the differences between the library element state diagram as presented in the previous page of the documentation portal.

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studystatediagram.png)

The next sections detail the graph transformations that take place on each of these state transitions.


#### 1. Create Study
```
State Before: None
Action: Create
State After: Draft
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studycreate.png)


When creating a new study, we create a new `StudyRoot` as well as an initial draft `StudyValue`. 
As part of the create, three types of study attributes can be specified:
- *Study Properties* (identifiers)
- *Study Fields* (Unversioned study metadata - such as the project, or study population) 
- *Study Selections* (Versioned study metadata - such as objectives/endpoints)

The following transformations take place in the graph:
- Create a StudyRoot `(root)` with a new UID.
- Create a StudyValue draft `(d)`. Set study properties on the node.
- If applicable, create `StudySelection` nodes pointing to the versioned object and levels.
- Link `(d)` to selections with a `HAS_SELECTION` relationship. (StudySelection nodes).
- Link `(d)` to  fields with a `HAS_FIELD` relationship (StudyField nodes).
- Link `(root)` and `(d)` with a `LATEST_DRAFT` relationship.
- Link `(root)` and `(d)` with a `HAS_DRAFT` relationship.

Update the audit trail:
- Create a node `(e:Action:Create)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Create an `AFTER` relationship from `(e)` to the new value `(d)`,
- Create `AFTER` relationships from `(e)` to each of the StudySelections.
- Create `AFTER` relationships from `(e)` to each of the StudyFields.

#### 2a. Edit Study Selections
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Edit Selection
State After: Draft
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyedita.png)

When a draft edit involves the change of study selections, the graph is modified as follows:

Consider a draft edit. Let `(root)` be the root, `(d)` be the existing draft node. The study must be in a draft state.

Graph transformations:
- Create new study selection nodes, pointing to the relevant library objects. Ensure the order is set correctly.

- For each of the removed selections, delete the `HAS_SELECTION` relationship coming in from the study value node `(d)`.
- For each of the created selections, add a `HAS_SELECTION` relationship, coming in from the study value node (d).

Maintain the audit trail:
- Create a new node `(e:StudyAction:Edit)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Let `(e)` point to the added selections with an `AFTER` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the removed selections with a `BEFORE` relationship.


> If selections have been replaced, ensure that the index property on the BEFORE/AFTER relationships match. For example, if “Selection 1” was replaced by “Selection 2”, the BEFORE relationship to “Selection 1” should have the same index as the AFTER relationship to “Selection 2”. 

#### 2b. Edit Study Fields
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Edit Study Field
State After: Draft
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyeditb.png)


When a draft edit involves the change of study fields, the graph is modified similar to study selection changes.
Consider a draft edit. Let `(root)` be the root, `(d)` be the existing draft node. The study root must not have any `LATEST_LOCKED` or `DELETED` relationships.

Graph transformations:
- Create new study field nodes if they do not exist. (Merge in the graph).
- For each of the removed fields, delete the `HAS_FIELD` relationship, coming in from the study value node `(d)`.
- For each of the created fields, add a `HAS_FIELD` relationship, coming in from the study value node `(d)`.

- Create a new `(e:StudyAction:Edit)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Let `(e)` point to the added fields with an AFTER relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the removed fields with a BEFORE relationship.

> If fields have been replaced, ensure that the index property on the BEFORE/AFTER relationships match. For example, if “Field 1” was replaced by “Field 2”, the BEFORE relationship to “Field 1” should have the same index as the AFTER relationship to “Field 2”. 

#### 2c. Edit Study Properties
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Edit Study Properties
State After: Draft
```


![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyeditc.png)

Study properties (identifiers) are expected to rarely change.
Although the operation of changing properties is expensive, we take the following approach to be as optimal as possible.
The approach below minimizes the number of relationship creates/deletes.

Consider a draft edit. Let `(root)` be the root, `(d1)` be the existing draft node. The study root must not have any `LATEST_LOCKED` relationships or any `DELETED` relationships. (e.g. it is draft state).

- Create a new StudyValue node `(d2)`.
- Copy over the properties from `(d1)` to `(d2)`.
- update the properties on `(d1)` to be the newly selected ones.

> We’re now repurposing (d1) as our ‘updated value’, whereas (d2) will represent the old value for the audit trail. Instead of using node `(d2)` for our new draft, we repurpose `(d1)`. This avoids moving all the `HAS_SELECTION`/`HAS_FIELD` relationships attached to `(d1)`.

We are now in the following state:
1. `(d2)` is disconnected from the graph.
2. `(d1)` is connected to many elements in the graph. (fields/selections)
3. `(d1)` has `AFTER` relationship(s) incoming from previous StudyActions `(e)`.

Next, we make sure that the previous StudyAction `(e)` (which was pointing to `(d1)`) now point to `(d2)`. Now, `(d1)` and `(d2)` have effectively switched places completely. 

Then:
- Create a node `(e2:Action:Edit)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e2)`.
- Let `(e2)` point to the new draft `(d1)` with an `AFTER` relationship.
- Let `(e2)` point to the old draft `(d2)` with a `BEFORE` relationship.

#### 3. Release
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Release
State After: Draft & Released
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyrelease.png)

Consider that we have a draft study node `(d)`. Then, we create a release.

- Create a new StudyValue node `(r)`. This will be the released version.
- If a `RELEASED` relationship already exists from the root, delete it. Old releases are not stored by relationships to the root.
- from the root, create a `RELEASED` relationship to `(r)`.
- Copy over all properties from the draft node `(d)` to the release node `(r)`.
- Copy all existing selection & field relationships from the old draft node to the released node.

Maintain the audit trail:
- Create an `(e:Action:Release)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Create a `BEFORE` relationship from `(e)` to `(d)`.
- Create an `AFTER` relationship from `(e)` to `(r)`.


#### 4. Lock & Release
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Lock & Release
State After: Locked & Released
```

> Unlike other versioned graph elements, locking a study implies an automatic release. A lock action will always trigger a release - this is to prevent the latest release from being an older version than the latest locked.

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studylock.png)

A lock operation always triggers a release. This is to ensure that the latest locked version will never be newer than the latest release.
When a draft gets locked, the study is no longer editable.

Graph Transformations:
- Remove the `HAS_DRAFT` and `LATEST_DRAFT` relationships incoming to `(d)`.
- Add a `LATEST_LOCKED` and a `LOCKED` relationship from the root to `(d)`.
- Add a `RELEASED` relationship from the root to `(d)`.
  
Maintain the audit trail:
- Create a node `(e:Action:Lock)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Create a `BEFORE` relationship from `(e)` to `(d)`.
- Create an `AFTER` relationship from `(e)` to `(d)`.

> From a graph perspective, no new study values are created - the latest draft (d) will just get different relationships. This is why the (e:Release:Action) node points twice to the same StudyValue.

#### 5. Unlock
```
State Before: Locked
Action: Unlock
State After: Draft
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyunlock.png)

In the graph, unlock a node is more complicated than locking a node:
We need to create a new study value node so that the old locked version is preserved in the audit trail.

Let `(lock)` be the previously locked and release node.

Graph transformations:
- Remove the `LATEST_LOCKED` relationship from the root to `(lock)`.
- Create a new StudyValue node `(d2)`. This will be the unlocked draft version.
- Create a `LATEST_DRAFT` & `HAS_DRAFT` relationship to `(d2)`.
- Copy over all study properties from the locked node `(lock)` to the new draft `(d2)`.
- Copy all existing `HAS_FIELD`/`HAS_SELECTION` relationships from the locked node to the draft node.

Maintain the audit trail:
- Create an `(e:Action:Unlock)` node with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Let `(e)` point to the new draft `(d2)` with an `AFTER` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the old locked version `(d1)` with a `BEFORE` relationship.

#### 6. Soft-Delete
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Soft-Delete
State After: Deleted
```

> A soft-delete implies that a StudyRoot will become inactive indefinitely. There is currently no way to reopen deleted studies.

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studydelete.png)


Graph Transformations:
- For the deleted study, we switch out the `StudyRoot` label for the `StudyRootDeleted` label.
- Given latest draft `(d)`, we switch out the `HAS_DRAFT` and `LATEST_DRAFT` relationships for a `DELETED` relationship.

Maintain the audit trail:
- Create a node `(e:Action:Delete)` with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(root)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Let `(e)` point to draft `(d)` with an `AFTER` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to draft `(d)`  with a `BEFORE` relationship.

There are prerequisites for performing a soft-delete:
- The study must have never been released.
- The study must have never been locked.


#### 7. Clone
```
State Before: Draft
Action: Clone
State After: Draft
```

![Study state diagram](~@source/images/model/physical_data_model/studyclone.png)


Cloning a draft means:
- creating a new `StudyRoot` & `StudyValue`. The new StudyValue will take over the properties of the cloned StudyValue.
- Creating new `StudySelection` nodes that point to the same library elements as the original StudySelection nodes.
- Linking the new `StudyValue` to all previously selected `StudyFields`.

Let `(r)` be a study root. Let `(d)` be the latest draft.

Graph transformations:
- Create a new root `(r2)`. Create a new draft `(d2)`.
- Copy all study properties on node `(d)` over to `(d2)`. 
- Link the new root `(r2)` to `(d2)` with `LATEST_DRAFT` and `HAS_DRAFT` relationships.
- Copy all study selection nodes attached to `(d)` into new nodes. Attach them all to `(d2)`. Link the new study selections to the original library elements that `(d)` was selecting.
- Attached `(d2)` to the original study fields that `(d)` was selecting.

Maintain the audit trail:
- Create an `(e:Action:Clone)` node with the current timestamp.
- Create a relationship `(r)-[a:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Create a relationship `(r2)-[a2:AUDIT_TRAIL]->(e)`.
- Let `(e)` point to the old draft `(d)` with an `BEFORE` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the old study selections/study fields with a `BEFORE` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the new draft `(d2)` with an `AFTER` relationship.
- Let `(e)` point to the new study selections/study fields with a `AFTER` relationship.

> Ensure that the index properties on the `BEFORE`/`AFTER` relationships are synced, such that the index of the field in the original study is the same as the index of the field in the new study.
