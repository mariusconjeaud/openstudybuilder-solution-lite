    ## Remove unwanted sponsor terms from Finding Subcategory Definition codelist.

    ### Change Description
    Because of typos in the data used when importing the Finding Subcategory codelist,
    two terms were created twice.
    The duplicates have a typo in the submission value.
    This causes the terms "Orientation" and "Comprehension" appear twice in the codelist.
    Since the unwanted terms have incorrect submission values, there is nothing else linking to them.
    The unwanted terms should be removed.

    ### Nodes and relationships affected
    - All nodes and relationships related to the unwanted terms are deleted:
      - Term root: `CTTermRoot`,
      - Term names: `CTTermNameRoot`, `CTTermNameValue`, `HAS_NAME_ROOT`, `HAS_VERSION`
      - Term attributes: `CTTermAttributesRoot`, `CTTermAttributesValue`, `HAS_ATTRIBUTES_ROOT`, `HAS_VERSION`
