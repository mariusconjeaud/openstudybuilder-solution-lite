## Reporting a Vulnerability
  
The OpenStudyBuilder team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.  
Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the OpenStudyBuilder team at:

`openstudybuilder+security@gmail.com`

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email as soon as possible, and will then send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavour to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.  
Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. However, feel free to give us a notice of the reported vulnerability - if the module allows for - so we can be prepared for an upcoming patch and/or mitigation actions.

Make sure to follow the Vulnerability Disclosure to not expose confidential data.
