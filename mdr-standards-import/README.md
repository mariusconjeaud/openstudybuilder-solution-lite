# Introduction 
As part of the Clinical MDR project, this repository takes care of the import of
* the controlled terminology (CT) from CDISC.

Later on, other imports like UNII, SNOMED, etc. might be added.

# Local Setup

## Setup python virtual environment

* Make sure Python 3.13.0 and Pipenv is installed on your machine. Installation guide can be found
 [here](https://dev.azure.com/novonordiskit/Clinical-MDR/_git/neo4j-mdr-db?path=/README.md&version=GBUpdate_README) under section Python Getting Started.
* Run `pipenv install`
---
## Setup environment variables

Create `.env` file (in the root of the repository) with the following content (adjust accordingly):

```
#
# Neo4j Database
#
NEO4J_MDR_BOLT_PORT=5078
NEO4J_MDR_HOST=localhost
NEO4J_MDR_AUTH_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_MDR_AUTH_PASSWORD=test1234
NEO4J_MDR_DATABASE=neo4j

NEO4J_CDISC_IMPORT_BOLT_PORT=5078
NEO4J_CDISC_IMPORT_HOST=localhost
NEO4J_CDISC_IMPORT_AUTH_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_CDISC_IMPORT_AUTH_PASSWORD=test1234
NEO4J_CDISC_IMPORT_DATABASE=cdisc

#
# CDISC API
# API token is not mandatory as the package
# folder is now placed in the repository
#
CDISC_BASE_URL="https://library.cdisc.org/api"
CDISC_AUTH_TOKEN="<<Insert secret here>>"

#
# Download folder for the CDISC JSON package files
#
CDISC_DATA_DIR="cdisc_data/packages"
```

**Note:** Bolt port number might need to be changed for different customised setup, but the above could do the trick for basic setup.

## Neo4j database setup

### CDISC DB

The CDISC DB will be created automatically including the index configuration. Nothing to do here.

### MDR DB

The MDR DB needs to be present and have the correct index configuration. See the instructions in the `neo4j-mdr-db` repository 
[README](https://dev.azure.com/novonordiskit/Clinical-MDR/_git/neo4j-mdr-db?path=/README.md&_a=preview) 
, after the step of `Initiate neo4j database` should do the trick basically.

## CDISC Data

* Download CT Packages from the CDISC REST API by running:
```shell
pipenv run download_ct_json_data_from_cdisc_api 'your-sub-directory'
```

* Download Data Model Versions from the CDISC REST API by running:
```shell
pipenv run download_data_models_json_data_from_cdisc_api 'your-sub-directory'
```

**Note:** These steps can be skipped as the JSON package files is now placed in the repository and will be downloaded when you clone the repository.
This is to avoid high usage of the CDISC API, as there is a rate-limit in place.

## Importing Entrypoints - Available for pipelines

### Import data to both CDISC and MDR databases
The following command will:
* trigger the import into the CDISC DB
* trigger the import into the MDR DB
* It will do so for both CT and Data Models, for all available packages

```shell
pipenv run bulk_import 'TEST' '' # Second argument is to specify a different data directory
```

You also have the option to separately bulk import CT and Data Models:

```shell
pipenv run bulk_import_ct 'TEST' ''
pipenv run bulk_import_data_models 'TEST' ''
```


### Import CT data to CDISC database only

The following command will:
* trigger the import of CT into the CDISC DB

```shell
pipenv run import_cdisc_ct_into_cdisc_db 'TEST' '' # Second argument is to specify a different data directory
```


### Import Data Models data to CDISC database only

The following command will:
* trigger the import of Data Models into the CDISC DB

```shell
pipenv run import_cdisc_data_models_into_cdisc_db 'TEST' ''  # Second argument is to specify a different data directory
```

### Import CT data to only MDR database

The following command will:
* trigger the import of a single CT package into the MDR DB

```shell
pipenv run import_ct_from_cdisc_db_into_mdr 'TEST' '2021-09-24'
```

### Import Data Models data to only MDR database

The following command will:
* triggers the import into the MDR DB

```shell
pipenv run import_data_models_from_cdisc_db_into_mdr 'TEST' ''  # Second argument is to specify a different data directory
```

## Verify setup is complete
* Open Neo4j browser in your web browser at the address: http://localhost:5074/ (or http://NEO4J_MDR_HOST:NEO4J_MDR_BOLT_PORT), log in with username and password stated in .env file in neo4j_database repository (default is username: neo4j, password: test1234)
* Switch to database cdisc, run command:
```
MATCH (p:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Codelist) WHERE c.effective_date=date("2015-12-18")
WITH p.name as name, count(c) AS count
RETURN name, count
```
* The output should be:
```
name	                count
"SDTM CT 2015-12-18"	480
"SEND CT 2015-12-18"	92
"ADAM CT 2015-12-18"	7
```
* Switch to database neo4j, run command:
```
MATCH (c:CTPackage)-[:CONTAINS_CODELIST]->(cc:CTPackageCodelist) WHERE c.effective_date=date("2015-12-18")
WITH c.name as name, count(cc) AS count
RETURN name, count
```
* The output should be the same as before:
```
name	                count
"SDTM CT 2015-12-18"	480
"SEND CT 2015-12-18"	92
"ADAM CT 2015-12-18"	7
```

## Further Development Commands

- drops the *intermediate* CDISC DB
```cypher
DROP DATABASE `cdisc` IF EXISTS
```

- deletes everything in the currently selected DB
```cypher
:auto MATCH ()-[r]-() CALL { WITH r DELETE r } IN TRANSACTIONS OF 50000 ROWS;
:auto MATCH (n) CALL { WITH n DELETE n } IN TRANSACTIONS OF 50000 ROWS;
```
